# ZOMBIE SHOOTER USING C#

## Overview
**ZOMBIE SHOOTER ONLY USING C#** has been made purely on C# Window Forms without any other editors like unity.You have to shoot the zombie while trying to get away from them to survive for as long as possible and kill as many zombies as you can while also managing your ammo usage.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository or download the script file.
2. Open the file usin visual studio.
3. Run the build and play the game.
   

## Controls
- Use the arrow keys to move the character around.
- Use spacebar to shoot the zombies.
- When your bullets finish you have to get the ammo supplies that spawn.


## Overview of Steps
- Imported the assets for the Player and zombies.
- Made the UI of the game in windows forms.
- Made the player move.
- Designed the bullets and programmed their behaviour in a seperate class.
- Spawned in the zombies and programmed them to always move towards the player.
- Assigned the bullets make the zombies disappear on contact by intersection of their hitboxes.
- Here i encountered a bug where there was an error appearing where there was an exception which was caused by the interaction of the picturebox and the progress bar.
- That bug breaked the game and I spent a lot of time in trying to fix it.
- In the end i rewrote the code from scratch whic somehow ficed the bug.
- In the end i gave a final touch by adding a game end screen.
